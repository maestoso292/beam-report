The aim of this project is to develop an Android app which uses proximity range detection to register the attendance of students in classrooms. Imagine a student entering a classroom, as the student with a smartphone moves into the proximity Bluetooth range of another studentâ€™s phone when they have already registered their attendance, their phone will automatically connect to the nearby student's phone. This will trigger the user's automatic attendance recording system. This cascade of registrations will initiate with the course lecturer opening the course for registration and a first round of students getting registered by coming into the range of the lecturer's phone. This first round of students will then be able to act as proxy for registering other students, so that not every single student has to enter the lecturer's Bluetooth transmission range (typically around 10m).

The app will use Bluetooth Low Energy for proximity detection of nearby smartphones, and for data exchange. This project attempts to leverage a technology that lets phones within a certain location collaborate to perform certain tasks. One current application of this technology is contact tracing of COVID-19 cases.
