\subsubsection{Manual Data Entry}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Login with \textit{hcyyk1@nottingham.edu.my} (email) and \textit{123456} (password)
\item Input data into the text fields of desired components
\item Since the marker will likely not have access to the database, check the demo video for the testing results
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Automated Data Entry}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure you have Microsoft Edge \textit{Version 90.0.818.46} and its corresponding \textit{Selenium x64 WebDriver} (download link: \url{https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/}). If you have a different Edge browser version, you can download the latest corresponding WebDriver with the link above. The WebDriver must be installed in the same directory as \textit{main.exe} in \textit{Website Automated Test}.
\item In \textit{Website Automated Test} directory, click \textit{main.exe}.
\item Since the marker will likely not have access to the database, check the demo video for the testing results
